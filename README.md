## Project Overview

The **Housing Estate Manager** is a software application built using Object-Oriented Programming principles. It allows users to manage housing estates, residents, properties, and other related entities. The project is designed to demonstrate clean code practices, modular architecture, and efficient data management.

Key entities in the system include:
- **Housing Estates**: Manage multiple housing estates with unique properties.
- **Residents**: Track residents and their details.
- **Properties**: Manage individual properties within estates (e.g., apartments, houses).
- **Operations**: Perform operations like adding, updating, or removing entities.

## Features

- **Estate Management**: Add, update, and delete housing estates.
- **Resident Management**: Manage resident information, including contact details and property assignments.
- **Property Management**: Track properties within estates, including ownership and occupancy status.
- **Modular Design**: The project is built with a modular architecture, making it easy to extend and maintain.
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load data to/from files or databases (if implemented).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A console-based or GUI interface for easy interaction (depending on implementation).

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: [Python](https://www.python.org/) (or another language, depending on the project)
- **OOP Principles**: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
- **Data Storage**: JSON, CSV, or a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL).
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for collaboration and versioning.
- **Testing**: Unit testing frameworks (e.g., PyTest, JUnit).
